# SQS Repo
Squarespace code &amp; extensions that I built myself to accomplish
what Squarespace either doesn't support or what Squarespace does not
provide a configuration for. Most code uses vanila JS and Jquery.

## Usage
My intent is that every piece of code in this specific repo be
available to the public under the [
CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
(free, unrestricted use of any portion of this repo, with no 
attribution or payment required). It is possible that I didn't
get the licensing exactly right, but I promise I won't come after
you ;) 

The flip side of that, is that I offer **no guarantees** as to the
safety or efficacy of any code in this repo. Use and adapt it at
your own risk. 

If you find this repo helpful to you or your business, please consider
donating to [the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/give/now), the [National
Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/donate), or a
similarly impactful and awesome organization. If you did that and still
want to say thanks, my Venmo is 
[@ezraeinhorn](https://venmo.com/user/ezraeinhorn).
